# Whack-A-Mole

An interactive arcade game developed in **Microsoft MakeCode Arcade** using block-based logic compiled to TypeScript. The game challenges players to hit randomly appearing moles before they disappear, tracking scores and increasing difficulty over time.

## Highlights
- Designed all core gameplay logic: random mole spawning, hit detection, score tracking, and timed game sessions
- Implemented **event-driven programming** in MakeCode, translating block-based logic to clean TypeScript
- Created and optimized **custom pixel art sprites** for moles, backgrounds, and UI
- Configured difficulty scaling by adjusting mole spawn intervals as the game progresses
- Built for **cross-platform deployment** — playable in browser or on MakeCode Arcade–compatible handheld devices
